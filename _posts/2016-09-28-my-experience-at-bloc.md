title: My Experience at Bloc
---

My experience at [Bloc](https://www.bloc.io) has been great. I relate my studying at Bloc as actually _working_ at a job. Since its completely hands-on it has been learning through working. I'm happy that I'm not sitting through listening long lectures. We as humans learn more by doing things than listening, so Bloc's model is working well with me. It's been 7 weeks of doing lot of work, learning lots of new stuff related to Web Development and I'm curious and looking ahead towards learning lots more.
