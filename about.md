Hi,

My name is Meghana Singh, I'm an Electronics and Communications Engineer with experience in the semiconductor industry. After having experience in the hardware industry, I decided to try my hand on software programming. I believe in never stop learning and this quest got me into learning new languages and frameworks in the software field. 
 
Do visit my [GitHub page](https://github.com/meghana-singh?tab=repositories) to get technical insight into my codes. Here in my portfolio I have shared some of the apps I have enjoyed building. 

On a personal front, I live with my husband, son and daughter in the Bay area of San Francisco. I love to go out on hikes and picnics with my family. I enjoy doodling, sketching and trying my hand on cooking new recipes. 

Meghana
